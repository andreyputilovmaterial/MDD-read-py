# MDD-read-py
Read MDD files in python. The result of running code in this repository is json, but the final result we need is html. So it includes MDD-HTMLReport-py submodule necessary for generating html.

## Usage
1. just open run.bat
2. and set MDD to your file; it should not be necessarily located in the same directory
3. run the bat file and find results in html in the same directory as your MDD
